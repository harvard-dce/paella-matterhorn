Paella Player for Matterhorn
============================
This is the Paella player for Matterhorn bundle.

Development
===========

Branches and tags
-----------------

- To add a feature or fix a bug, create a branch off of **master**. When it is ready to be reviewed and tested, create a pull request from it to master.
- Tags are used to indicate which version of Paella this project is using. When you update the Paella submodule, tag paella-matterhorn with `paella` + the Paella tag + `-` + an hudce Matterhorn release version. i.e. `paella4.1.18/dceoc1.5.1-1.25.0`.

Grunt
-----

Prerequisites:

- Run `npm install`.
- Run `npm install -g grunt-cli` or `sudo npm install -g grunt-cli` if you cannot write to your global node_modules directory.

You need to run `grunt` to build everything. Matterhorn's maven process runs this Gruntfile, too. `server.debug` is the default target because we do not currently minify for production

Among other things, it:

- Copies files from the `dce-paella-extensions` module into `submodules/paella` and various other places (see the [Makefile](https://github.com/harvard-dce/paella-matterhorn/blob/using-upstream-paella-directly/Makefile) for details).
- Copies files from `submodules/paella` into `build`. The paella submodule is the [upstream paella](https://github.com/polimediaupv/paella), not a fork.
- Also copies files from `paella-matterhorn/ui` into `build`.
- Concatenates the .less files together.
- Concatenates the files from `paella-matterhorn/javascript` and `paella-matterhorn/plugins` into `paella_matterhorn.js`.
- Concatenates localization json files together.

Dependencies
------------

dce-paella-extensions is a dependency that contains DCE-specific Paella changes. Its version is specified as a tilde range, which means that NPM will install the latest version of dce-paella-extensions that matches the major and minor versions. e.g. If ~1.0.27 is the version in package.json, NPM will install the 1.0.30 if it is available. It will not install 1.1.0. You need to change the version in package.json if you want that version.

This project uses [NPM Shrinkwrap](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/shrinkwrap). It installs modules from the `npm-shrinkwrap.json` file, not the `package.json` file and will install the exact versions of the dependencies and subdependencies defined in `npm-shrinkwrap.json`. If you want to update dependencies, you must run `npm install --save <module name>@<version>` or `npm update --save <module name>` in order to update both `package.json` and `npm-shrinkwrap.json`.

[player-router](https://github.com/harvard-dce/player-router) handles URL hash-based routing. app-src/index.js is the module within paella-matterhorn that handles webapp functionality external to Paella.

Running locally
---------------

If you want to run paella-matterhorn locally without deploying it as a jar within matterhorn (and matterhorn.dce.harvard.edu is currently OK), run:

    make run-test-server

This will create a server that will serve local copies of files under `build/` and will serve a canned `episode.json` and `me.json`, but will proxy everything else (like series information) to matterhorn.dce.harvard.edu.

To play a video in the test server, take a URL from production (matterhorn.dce.harvard.edu) and replace the host with localhost:3000. Make sure you use the https protocol.

Tests
-----

To run parent frame communcation and player router tests, do:

    npm install
    make test-chrome
    make test-firefox

This should run the tests in Chrome and Firefox respectively, and in your terminal, you should see the test results.

Non-Paella parts of the project
-------------------------------

In `app-src`, there are modules that get built into `app-index.js` via Browserify. `app-index.js` gets pulled into the web page at [paella-matterhorn/ui/watch.html](https://github.com/harvard-dce/paella-matterhorn/blob/master/paella-matterhorn/ui/watch.html).

Paella Player
=============
The Paella (pronounce “paeja”) Player is a HTML5 multistream video player capable of playing multiple audio & video streams synchronously and supporting a number of user plugins. It is specially designed for lecture recordings, like Matterhorn Lectures or Polimedia pills.

By using Paella students can view both the lecture hall and the teacher's screen, get info about the lecture (slides, OCR, series videos, footprints) and interact with the lecture (views, comments). Teachers can also soft edit the lecture to set the start and end point or make breaks in the recording. 

If you want to use Paella player, but does not have a Matterhorn installation, you can use the [standalone](https://github.com/polimediaupv/paella) version of paella.
